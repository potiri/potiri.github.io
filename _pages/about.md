Hi! I'm Lena, a PhD student at the [chair of information systems (Prof. Dr. Günther Pernul)](https://www.uni-regensburg.de/informatik-data-science/wi-pernul/startseite/index.html) at the University of Regensburg. My research evolves about human-centric aspects of security and privacy. 

My PhD topic, in particular, is about exploring the potential of cyber ranges, replications of real systems, as a way to train individuals to detect and mitigate cyber attacks. 

During my PhD I was involved in the INSIST project, funded by the Bavarian StMWi, about securing the Industrial Internet of Things by buidling an Industrial Security Operations Center.

You can find news about our group and my research on our [lab website](https://www.uni-regensburg.de/informatik-data-science/wi-pernul/new-s/index.html).

Whenever I'm not at university or in front of a computer, you will most likely find me climbing, cycling or looking for the best aperitivo places in Regensburg.
