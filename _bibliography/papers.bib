abstract = {Humans can play a decisive role in detecting and mitigating cyber attacks if they possess sufficient cybersecurity skills and knowledge. Realizing this potential requires effective cybersecurity training. Cyber range exercises (CRXs) represent a novel form of cybersecurity training in which trainees can experience realistic cyber attacks in authentic environments. Although evaluation is undeniably essential for any learning environment, it has been widely neglected in CRX research. Addressing this issue, we propose a taxonomy-based framework to facilitate a comprehensive and structured evaluation of CRXs. To demonstrate the applicability and potential of the framework, we instantiate it to evaluate Iceberg CRX, a training we recently developed to improve cybersecurity education at our university. For this matter, we conducted a user study with 50 students to identify both strengths and weaknesses of the CRX.},

abstract = {The global shortage of cybersecurity professionals poses a daunting challenge for organizations seeking to protect their assets and data. To counteract this workforce shortage, cyber range exercises (CRXs) can equip individuals with the necessary knowledge and skills to become security professionals. However, the complexity of CRXs tends to overwhelm trainees with little prior cybersecurity experience, resulting in ineffective learning experiences. To address this issue, we take an interdisciplinary approach, leveraging established models on learning and motivation for cybersecurity. In this pursuit, we propose a literature-based framework of six design principles that aim to facilitate CRX designers in creating more effective CRXs. To illustrate the framework’s utility, we introduce a CRX for incident response built upon these principles. To evaluate the effectiveness of this principle-driven CRX design, we conducted a user study with N=89 participants. The results of this study showed that the design provided an engaging learning experience that enabled participants to effectively acquire incident response knowledge and skills.}

        abstract = {Cyberattacks pose a persistent threat to organizations worldwide. These attacks often target employees as entry points to organizational systems through tactics like phishing and credential theft. Recognizing employees as an organization's "last line of defense", motivating employees toward security-compliant behavior becomes paramount. While existing literature investigates theoretical frameworks for enhancing individuals' motivation, studies regarding their practical implementation within organizational contexts remain scarce. This paper seeks to address this research gap by exploring how organizations motivate and in-centivize security-compliant behavior among employees in Germany. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 18 participants from diverse organizational backgrounds, illuminating the topic from three perspectives: Executive managers, security specialists, and regular employees. Utilizing a classification derived from existing literature, we examine our findings to identify which motivational strategies are currently implemented effectively within organizational contexts. On this basis, we offer a set of actionable recommendations on how organizations can enhance and complement existing motivational strategies.}

abstract = {The importance of automotive cybersecurity is increasing in tandem with the evolution of more complex vehicles, fueled by trends like V2X or over-the-air updates. Regulatory bodies are trying to cope with this problem with the introduction of ISO 21434, which standardizes automotive cybersecurity engineering. One piece of the puzzle for compliant cybersecurity engineering is the creation of a TARA (Threat Analysis and Risk Assessment) for identifying and managing cybersecurity risks. The more time security experts invest in creating a TARA, the more detailed and mature it becomes. Thus, organizations must balance the benefits of a more mature TARA against the costs and resources required to achieve it. However, there is a lack of guidance on determining the appropriate level of effort. In this paper, we propose a data-driven maturity model as a management utility facilitating the decision on the maturity-cost trade-off for creating TARAs. To evaluate the model, we conducted interviews with seven automotive cybersecurity experts from the industry.},

        abstract = {The emergence of the artificial intelligence (AI) tool Chat-GPT has created great excitement and unprecedented potential in various fields. Users are increasingly recognizing its benefits in aiding with work-related tasks and are incorporating it into their work routines. However, unconscious use of ChatGPT poses a risk to an organization if employees inadvertently disclose sensitive information. To date, there is a lack of research examining individuals' perceptions of the security and privacy implications of ChatGPT use in organizational contexts. To bridge this gap, this study examines employees' perceptions of security and privacy-related risks of using ChatGPT for work-related tasks and their strategies to mitigate these risks. Employing grounded theory, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 17 participants from 15 organizations across a range of professions and industries. Our findings indicate that employees have a general awareness of security and privacy-related risks, albeit with some uncertainties and misconceptions. While organizational guidelines for managing these risks are largely absent, participants describe that they employ self-determined strategies to avoid sharing sensitive data.}

To evaluate its effect on the learning process of the trainees we conducted a user study with an experimental group using the VPL and a control group using textual programming. The evaluation results demonstrated a positive impact of the VPL on the trainees' learning experience. The trainees in the VPL group achieved equally good learning outcomes as those in the control group but rated the subjective workload as lower and perceived the training as more interesting.",

abstract="The shortage of skilled cybersecurity professionals poses a significant challenge for organizations seeking to protect their assets and data. To address this shortage, onboarding and reskilling employees for cybersecurity positions becomes a daunting task for organizations. Cyber ranges mirror digital infrastructures to provide a realistic yet safe environment for cybersecurity training. To date, the potential of cyber ranges has been leveraged primarily in academic education. This paper investigates how cyber range exercises (CRX) can enhance the onboarding and reskilling of cybersecurity professionals in organizations. To this end, we conducted semi-structured interviews with seven cybersecurity professionals from organizations in different industry sectors in Germany and India. Our findings indicate that the main potential of CRXs lies in conveying universal cybersecurity concepts that are transferable to the particular systems, technologies and tools of an organization. Thereby, CRXs represent a promising complement to existing organizational training strategies. Challenges to overcome were identified in establishing an organizational CRX infrastructure, building the necessary competencies to conduct the exercises, and ensuring the comparability of CRXs to validate personal competence development.",

abstract="The Internet of Things (IoT) is finding increasing application in different areas, whether for private users or in industrial plants. The IoT increases the attack surface for Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) due to insufficiently secured IoT devices and networks. The heterogeneous structure of the IoT poses several new challenges for the application of IoT forensics (IoTF). Due to limited resources and storage capacity on the devices, the application of traditional forensics is not possible. Therefore, the nature of these IoT devices urges forensic experts to extract and analyze possibly relevant data in a real-time manner from running devices by applying Live Digital Forensics (LDF). Although LDF investigations are not commonly applied in the IoT context yet, IoTF could benefit largely from a combined arms approach with LDF. Thus, security experts with sufficient skills and knowledge will be required to perform such procedures. Addressing the challenge to equip future forensic experts with these skills and knowledge, we propose a concept for an educational IoT Cyber Range for LDF for postgraduate cybersecurity learners. For a realistic learning experience, we outline the simulation of a simplistic, underlying IoT system. In order to create an environment that is as realistic as possible, we describe an illustrative scenario that serves as a motivational story. Following the scenario, learners carry out several tasks of an IoTF investigation for solving the scenario.",

abstract="Security Operations Centers (SOCs) provide a holistic view of a company's security operations. While aiming to harness this potential, companies are lacking sufficiently skilled cybersecurity analysts. One approach to meet this demand is to create a cyber range to equip potential analysts with the skills required. The digital twin paradigm offers great benefit by providing a realistic virtual environment to create a cyber range. However, to the best of our knowledge, tapping this potential to train SOC analysts has not been attempted yet. To address this research gap, a concept of a digital twin-based cyber range for SOC analysts is proposed and implemented. As part of the virtual training environment, several attacks against an industrial system are simulated. Being provided with a SIEM system that displays the real-time log data, the trainees solve increasingly complex tasks in which they have to detect the attacks performed against the system. Thereby, they learn how to interact with a SIEM system and create rules that correlate events aiming to detect security incidents. To evaluate the implemented cyber range, a comprehensive user study demonstrates a significant increase of knowledge within SIEM-related topics among the participants. Additionally, it indicates that the cyber range was subjectively perceived as a positive learning experience by the participants.",
